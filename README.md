## 🧠 Why I'm Building This

This project is part of my journey to **strengthen my backend development skills** and build something real, not just tutorials.  
I'm sharing each step — from schema design to authentication — publicly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE) as I go.  
The goal is to show recruiters and engineers how I think, build, and iterate.
