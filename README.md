<h1>Hi, I'm Grecia!</h1> 
<h2>Check out my current project:</h2>

This is an in-progress backend project built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **Flyway**.  
This project is part of my journey to strengthen my backend development skills and build something real, not just tutorials.
I'm sharing each step, from schema design to authentication.  Here is a link to the [repo](https://github.com/Gigi-Pons/triviaApp), feel free to make any comments.
